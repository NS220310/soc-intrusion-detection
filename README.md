# 🛡️ SOC Intrusion Detection & Campaign Analysis System

A **multi-stage SOC (Security Operations Center) analytics pipeline** for detecting, correlating, and summarizing cyber attacks from network flow data using Machine Learning.

The system follows a hierarchical approach:

> Flow-level Detection → Behavioral Correlation → Campaign-level Intelligence → (LLM-based Explanation)

## 🚀 Features

- Binary intrusion detection (Normal vs Attack)
- Multiclass attack classification (Recon, Fuzzers, Exploits, etc.)
- Modular preprocessing pipeline (UNSW-NB15 compatible)
- Event abstraction layer (flow → security event)
- Campaign-level correlation module
- Anomaly detection *(in progress)*
- Clustering-based campaign discovery *(in progress)*
- LLM-based explanation *(planned)*
